# Phase 05 Evidence Register

## 1. Quy Tắc

- Status: `Planned`, `Prepared`, `Collected`, `Verified`, `Rejected`, `Not Applicable`.
- `Prepared`: artifact đã soạn trên branch nhưng chưa merge.
- `Collected`: có path/URL/command/result thật.
- `Verified`: reviewer hoặc automated gate đã xác nhận evidence gắn với đúng commit.
- Không ghi password, cookie, token, Atlas URI, answer key, private Student work hoặc signed URL vào evidence.
- Evidence phải tái lập được; “đã test” không kèm command/report/count/commit không hợp lệ.
